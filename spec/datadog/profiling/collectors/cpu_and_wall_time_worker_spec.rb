          # 3. ...our signal arrives, and our call to `rb_postponed_job_register_one` clobbers the existing job
          # 4. Ruby then proceeds to execute what it thinks is the correct job, but it actually has been clobbered
          #    and it triggers a profiler sample
          # 5. Then Ruby notices there's a new job to execute, and triggers the profiler sample again
          # And both samples are taken because this test runs without dynamic sampling rate.
          #
          # To avoid the flakiness, I've added a dummy margin here but... yeah in practice this can happen as many times
