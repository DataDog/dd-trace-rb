# Each test run requires its own unique command_name.
# When running `rake spec:test_name`, the test process doesn't have access to the
# rake task process, so we have come up with unique values ourselves.
#
# The current approach is to combine the ruby engine (ruby-2.7,jruby-9.2),
# program name (rspec/test), command line arguments (--pattern spec/**/*_spec.rb),
# and the loaded gemset.
#
# This should allow us to distinguish between runs with the same tests, but different gemsets:
#   * appraisal rails5-mysql2 rake spec:rails
#   * appraisal rails5-postgres rake spec:rails
#
# Subsequent runs of the same exact test suite should have the same command_name.
