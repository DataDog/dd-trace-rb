"Instrumentation" part of Dynamic Instrumentation benchmarks.

Typical result:

Comparison:
  no instrumentation:   589490.0 i/s
method instrumentation - cleared:   545807.2 i/s - 1.08x  slower
line instrumentation - cleared:   539686.5 i/s - 1.09x  slower
no instrumentation - again:   535761.0 i/s - 1.10x  slower
method instrumentation:   129159.5 i/s - 4.56x  slower
line instrumentation - targeted:   128848.6 i/s - 4.58x  slower
line instrumentation:    10771.7 i/s - 54.73x  slower

Targeted line and method instrumentations have similar performance at
about 25% of baseline. Note that the instrumented method is fairly
small and probably runs very quickly by itself, so while this is not the
worst possible case for instrumentation (that would be an empty method),
likely the vast majority of real world uses of DI would have way expensive
target code and the relative overhead of instrumentation will be significantly
lower than it is in this benchmark.

Untargeted line instrumentation is extremely slow, too slow to be usable.

In theory, after instrumentation is removed, performance should return to
the baseline. We are currently observing about a 6-10% performance loss.
Two theories for why this is so:
1. Some overhead remains in the code - to be investigated.
2. The benchmarks were run on a laptop, and during the benchmarking
process the CPU is heating up and it can't turbo to the same speeds at
the end of the run as it can at the beginning. Meaning the observed 6-10%
slowdown at the end is an environmental issue and not an implementation
problem.
