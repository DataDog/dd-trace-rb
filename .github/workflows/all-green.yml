          # How long to wait before we start checking the job status
          # GitHub's API has a limit, so this helps avoid making too many calls
          # Note: If the job is retried, we'll check it once right away before waiting
          # Why 3 minutes: If a job fails, the all-green job also fails. If the original
          # job is retried and the all-green job is retried, the all-green job will not
          # see that all jobs are successful on the first invocation (since the failed
          # job is still running). But because we are not running the full test suite,
          # we do not want to wait 15 minutes to check if everything passed.
