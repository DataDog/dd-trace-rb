name: Update Gemfiles

# This action cannot be skipped altogether because it is a mandatory status check.
# Instead we conditionally skip it at job level, instead of workflow level.
on:
  # Execute on `push` and not `pull_request` because `pull_request`
  # always compares if the `paths` have changed compared to the PR base.
  # This is an issue because it means that all commits to the branch
  # will trigger the gemfile update process, which is unnecessary and expensive.
  #
  # By executing on `push`, GitHub compares `paths` with the parent commit,
  # meaning the gemfile update process will only execute on the exact commit
  # that changes any of the `paths`.
  #
  # Because this process is slow and expensive, and we commit the gemfile changes back
  # to the branch, we have an additional filter to only execute this action on branches
  # attached to a PR.
  #
  # We could do the inverse: execute this action on `pull_request`, and additionally check
  # if `paths` was changed compared to the parent commit, but this proved more complicated.
  push

# Ensure obsolete job is cancelled if another commit is pushed to the same branch.
