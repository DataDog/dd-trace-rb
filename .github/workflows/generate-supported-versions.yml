            This is a PR to update the table for supported integration versions.
            The supported versions markdown is generated from the minimum and maximum tested versions of each integration,
            as defined from the `gemfile.lock` gem declarations.

            Workflow run: [Generate Supported Versions](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-rb/actions/workflows/generate-supported-versions.yml)
            
            This should be tied to tracer releases, or triggered manually.
