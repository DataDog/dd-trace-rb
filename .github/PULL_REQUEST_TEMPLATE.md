We already know what the PR does (from the PR title),
but users should know either:
* A migration path for this change. In other words, how to continue using their application without behavior changes
in 2.0 (e.g. environment variable 'X' renamed to 'Y').
* That there's no alternative; we completely dropped support for this feature.
