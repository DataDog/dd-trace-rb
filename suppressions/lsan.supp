# This is a Leak Sanitizer ("lsan") suppression configuration file.
#
# We use it together with special builds for Ruby
# (https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/doc/contributing/building_ruby.md#building-with-address-sanitizer)
# to find issues and memory leaks in the dd-trace-rb native extensions; in some cases
# we need to ignore potential issues as they're not something we can fix (e.g. outside our code.)
#
# See https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer for details.
