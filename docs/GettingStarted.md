# Datadog Trace Client

``ddtrace`` is Datadogâ€™s tracing client for Ruby. It is used to trace requests as they flow across web servers,
databases and microservices so that developers have great visiblity into bottlenecks and troublesome requests.

## Install the gem

Install the tracing client, adding the following gem in your ``Gemfile``:

    source 'https://rubygems.org'

    # tracing gem
    gem 'ddtrace'

If you're not using ``Bundler`` to manage your dependencies, you can install ``ddtrace`` with:

    gem install ddtrace

We strongly suggest pinning the version of the library you deploy.

## Quickstart

The easiest way to get started with the tracing client is to instrument your web application.
All configuration is done through ``Datadog.configure`` method. As an
example, below is a setup that enables auto instrumentation for Rails, Redis and
Grape, and sets a custom endpoint for the trace agent:

    # config/initializers/datadog-tracer.rb

    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.tracer hostname: 'trace-agent.local'
      c.use :rails
      c.use :grape
      c.use :redis, service_name: 'cache'
    end

For further details and options, check our integrations list.

## Web Frameworks

### Ruby on Rails

The Rails integration will trace requests, database calls, templates rendering and cache read/write/delete
operations. The integration makes use of the Active Support Instrumentation, listening to the Notification API
so that any operation instrumented by the API is traced.

To enable the Rails auto instrumentation, create an initializer file in your ``config/`` folder:

    # config/initializers/datadog-tracer.rb

    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.use :rails, options
    end

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:


| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``service_name`` | Service name used when tracing application requests (on the `rack` level) | ``<app_name>`` (inferred from your Rails application namespace) |
| ``controller_service`` | Service name used when tracing a Rails action controller | ``<app_name>-controller`` |
| ``cache_service`` | Cache service name used when tracing cache activity | ``<app_name>-cache`` |
| ``database_service`` | Database service name used when tracing database activity | ``<app_name>-<adapter_name>`` |
| ``exception_controller`` | Class or Module which identifies a custom exception controller class. Tracer provides improved error behavior when it can identify custom exception controllers. By default, without this option, it 'guesses' what a custom exception controller looks like. Providing this option aids this identification. | ``nil`` |
| ``distributed_tracing`` | Enables [distributed tracing](#Distributed_Tracing) so that this service trace is connected with a trace of another service if tracing headers are received | `false` |
| ``controller_callback_tracing`` | Enables controller callback tracing (e.g. `before_action`). *Experimental feature: it is considered unstable! Only supports Rails 5.0.x and 5.1.x. May break with any update to Rails; use with extreme caution.* | `false` |
| ``template_base_path`` | Used when the template name is parsed. If you don't store your templates in the ``views/`` folder, you may need to change this value | ``views/`` |
| ``tracer`` | A ``Datadog::Tracer`` instance used to instrument the application. Usually you don't need to set that. | ``Datadog.tracer`` |

### Sinatra

The Sinatra integration traces requests and template rendering.

To start using the tracing client, make sure you import ``ddtrace`` and ``ddtrace/contrib/sinatra/tracer`` after
either ``sinatra`` or ``sinatra/base``:

    require 'sinatra'
    require 'ddtrace'
    require 'ddtrace/contrib/sinatra/tracer'

    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.use :sinatra, options
    end

    get '/' do
      'Hello world!'
    end

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``service_name`` | Service name used for `sinatra` instrumentation | sinatra |
| ``resource_script_names`` | Prepend resource names with script name | ``false`` |
| ``distributed_tracing`` | Enables [distributed tracing](#Distributed_Tracing) so that this service trace is connected with a trace of another service if tracing headers are received | `false` |
| ``tracer`` | A ``Datadog::Tracer`` instance used to instrument the application. Usually you don't need to set that. | ``Datadog.tracer`` |

### Rack

The Rack integration provides a middleware that traces all requests before they reach the underlying framework
or application. It responds to the Rack minimal interface, providing reasonable values that can be
retrieved at the Rack level. This integration is automatically activated with web frameworks like Rails.
If you're using a plain Rack application, just enable the integration it to your ``config.ru``:

    # config.ru example
    require 'ddtrace'

    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.use :rack, options
    end

    use Datadog::Contrib::Rack::TraceMiddleware

    app = proc do |env|
      [ 200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, ['OK'] ]
    end

    run app

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``service_name`` | Service name used when tracing application requests | rack |
| ``distributed_tracing`` | Enables [distributed tracing](#Distributed_Tracing) so that this service trace is connected with a trace of another service if tracing headers are received | `false` |
| ``middleware_names`` | Enable this if you want to use the middleware classes as the resource names for `rack` spans | ``false`` |
| ``tracer`` | A ``Datadog::Tracer`` instance used to instrument the application. Usually you don't need to set that. | ``Datadog.tracer`` |

## Other libraries

### GraphQL

*Version 1.7.9+ supported*

The GraphQL integration activates instrumentation for GraphQL queries. To activate your integration, use the ``Datadog.configure`` method:

    # Inside Rails initializer or equivalent
    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.use :graphql,
            service_name: 'graphql',
            schemas: [YourSchema]
    end

    # Then run a GraphQL query
    YourSchema.execute(query, variables: {}, context: {}, operation_name: nil)

The `use :graphql` method accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``service_name`` | Service name used for `graphql` instrumentation | ``ruby-graphql`` |
| ``schemas`` | Required. Array of `GraphQL::Schema` objects which to trace. Tracing will be added to all the schemas listed, using the options provided to this configuration. If you do not provide any, then tracing will not be activated. | ``[]`` |
| ``tracer`` | A ``Datadog::Tracer`` instance used to instrument the application. Usually you don't need to set that. | ``Datadog.tracer`` |

##### Manually configuring GraphQL schemas

If you prefer to individually configure the tracer settings for a schema (e.g. you have multiple schemas with different service names),
in the schema definition, you can add the following [using the GraphQL API](http://graphql-ruby.org/queries/tracing.html):

```
YourSchema = GraphQL::Schema.define do
  use(
    GraphQL::Tracing::DataDogTracing,
    service: 'graphql'
  )
end
```

Or you can modify an already defined schema:

```
YourSchema.define do
  use(
    GraphQL::Tracing::DataDogTracing,
    service: 'graphql'
  )
end
```

Do *not* `use :graphql` in `Datadog.configure` if you choose to configure manually, as to avoid double tracing. These two means of configuring GraphQL tracing are considered mutually exclusive.

### Grape

The Grape integration adds the instrumentation to Grape endpoints and filters. This integration can work side by side
with other integrations like Rack and Rails. To activate your integration, use the ``Datadog.configure`` method before
defining your Grape application:

    # api.rb
    require 'grape'
    require 'ddtrace'

    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.use :grape, options
    end

    # then define your application
    class RackTestingAPI < Grape::API
      desc 'main endpoint'
      get :success do
        'Hello world!'
      end
    end

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``service_name`` | Service name used for `grape` instrumentation | grape |

### Active Record

Most of the time, Active Record is set up as part of a web framework (Rails, Sinatra...)
however it can be set up alone:

    require 'tmpdir'
    require 'sqlite3'
    require 'active_record'
    require 'ddtrace'

    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.use :active_record, options
    end

    Dir::Tmpname.create(['test', '.sqlite']) do |db|
      conn = ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: 'sqlite3',
                                                     database: db)
      conn.connection.execute('SELECT 42') # traced!
    end

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``service_name`` | Service name used for database portion of `active_record` instrumentation. | Name of database adapter (e.g. `mysql2`) |
| ``orm_service_name`` | Service name used for the Ruby ORM portion of `active_record` instrumentation. Overrides service name for ORM spans if explicitly set, which otherwise inherit their service from their parent.  | ``active_record`` |

### Elastic Search

The Elasticsearch integration will trace any call to ``perform_request``
in the ``Client`` object:

    require 'elasticsearch/transport'
    require 'ddtrace'

    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.use :elasticsearch, options
    end

    # now do your Elastic Search stuff, eg:
    client = Elasticsearch::Client.new url: 'http://127.0.0.1:9200'
    response = client.perform_request 'GET', '_cluster/health'

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``service_name`` | Service name used for `elasticsearch` instrumentation | elasticsearch |

### MongoDB

The integration traces any `Command` that is sent from the
[MongoDB Ruby Driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver) to a MongoDB cluster.
By extension, Object Document Mappers (ODM) such as Mongoid are automatically instrumented
if they use the official Ruby driver. To activate the integration, simply:

    require 'mongo'
    require 'ddtrace'

    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.use :mongo, options
    end

    # now create a MongoDB client and use it as usual:
    client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'artists')
    collection = client[:people]
    collection.insert_one({ name: 'Steve' })

    # In case you want to override the global configuration for a certain client instance
    Datadog.configure(client, service_name: 'mongodb-primary')

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``service_name`` | Service name used for `mongo` instrumentation | mongodb |

### Net/HTTP

The Net/HTTP integration will trace any HTTP call using the standard lib
Net::HTTP module.

    require 'net/http'
    require 'ddtrace'

    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.use :http, options
    end

    Net::HTTP.start('127.0.0.1', 8080) do |http|
      request = Net::HTTP::Get.new '/index'
      response = http.request request
    end

    content = Net::HTTP.get(URI('http://127.0.0.1/index.html'))

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``service_name`` | Service name used for `http` instrumentation | http |
| ``distributed_tracing`` | Enables distributed tracing | ``false`` |

If you wish to configure each connection object individually, you may use the ``Datadog.configure`` as it follows:

    client = Net::HTTP.new(host, port)
    Datadog.configure(client, options)

### Faraday

The `faraday` integration is available through the `ddtrace` middleware:

    require 'faraday'

## Advanced usage

### Configure the tracer

To change the default behavior of the Datadog tracer, you can provide custom options inside the `Datadog.configure` block as in:

    # config/initializers/datadog-tracer.rb

    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.tracer option_name: option_value, ...
    end

Available options are:

* ``enabled``: defines if the ``tracer`` is enabled or not. If set to ``false`` the code could be still instrumented
  because of other settings, but no spans are sent to the local trace agent.
* ``debug``: set to true to enable debug logging.
* ``hostname``: set the hostname of the trace agent.
* ``port``: set the port the trace agent is listening on.
* ``env``: set the environment. Rails users may set it to ``Rails.env`` to use their application settings.
* ``tags``: set global tags that should be applied to all spans. Defaults to an empty hash
* ``log``: defines a custom logger.

#### Using a custom logger

By default, all logs are processed by the default Ruby logger.
Typically, when using Rails, you should see the messages in your application log file.
Datadog client log messages are marked with ``[ddtrace]`` so you should be able
to isolate them from other messages.

Additionally, it is possible to override the default logger and replace it by a
custom one. This is done using the ``log`` attribute of the tracer.

    f = File.new("my-custom.log", "w+")           # Log messages should go there
    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.tracer log: Logger.new(f)                 # Overriding the default tracer
    end

    Datadog::Tracer.log.info { "this is typically called by tracing code" }

### Manual Instrumentation

If you aren't using a supported framework instrumentation, you may want to to manually instrument your code.
Adding tracing to your code is very simple. As an example, letâ€™s imagine we have a web server and we want
to trace requests to the home page:

    require 'ddtrace'
    require 'sinatra'
    require 'active_record'

    # a generic tracer that you can use across your application
    tracer = Datadog.tracer

    get '/' do
      tracer.trace('web.request') do |span|
        # set some span metadata
        span.service = 'my-web-site'
        span.resource = '/'

        # trace the activerecord call
        tracer.trace('posts.fetch') do
          @posts = Posts.order(created_at: :desc).limit(10)
        end

        # add some attributes and metrics
        span.set_tag('http.method', request.request_method)
        span.set_tag('posts.count', @posts.length)

        # trace the template rendering
        tracer.trace('template.render') do
          erb :index
        end
      end
    end

### Environment and tags

By default, the trace agent (not this library, but the program running in
the background collecting data from various clients) uses the tags
set in the agent config file, see our
[environments tutorial](https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/docs/tutorials/environments) for details.

These values can be overridden at the tracer level:

    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.tracer tags: { 'env' => 'prod' }
    end

This enables you to set this value on a per tracer basis, so you can have
for example several applications reporting for different environments on the same host.

Ultimately, tags can be set per span, but `env` should typically be the same
for all spans belonging to a given trace.

### Sampling

`ddtrace` can perform trace sampling. While the trace agent already samples
traces to reduce bandwidth usage, client sampling reduces performance
overhead.

`Datadog::RateSampler` samples a ratio of the traces. For example:

    # Sample rate is between 0 (nothing sampled) to 1 (everything sampled).
    sampler = Datadog::RateSampler.new(0.5) # sample 50% of the traces
    Datadog.configure do |c|
      c.tracer sampler: sampler
    end

#### Priority sampling

Priority sampling consists in deciding if a trace will be kept by using a priority attribute that will be propagated for distributed traces. Its value gives indication to the Agent and to the backend on how important the trace is.

The sampler can set the priority to the following values:

* `Datadog::Ext::Priority::AUTO_REJECT`: the sampler automatically decided to reject the trace.
* `Datadog::Ext::Priority::AUTO_KEEP`: the sampler automatically decided to keep the trace.

For now, priority sampling is disabled by default. Enabling it ensures that your sampled distributed traces will be complete. To enable the priority sampling:

```rb
Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.tracer priority_sampling: true
end
```

Once enabled, the sampler will automatically assign a priority of 0 or 1 to traces, depending on their service and volume.

You can also set this priority manually to either drop a non-interesting trace or to keep an important one. For that, set the `context#sampling_priority` to:

* `Datadog::Ext::Priority::USER_REJECT`: the user asked to reject the trace.
* `Datadog::Ext::Priority::USER_KEEP`: the user asked to keep the trace.

When not using [distributed tracing](#Distributed_Tracing), you may change the priority at any time,
as long as the trace is not finished yet.
But it has to be done before any context propagation (fork, RPC calls) to be effective in a distributed context.
Changing the priority after context has been propagated causes different parts of a distributed trace
to use different priorities. Some parts might be kept, some parts might be rejected,
and this can cause the trace to be partially stored and remain incomplete.

If you change the priority, we recommend you do it as soon as possible, when the root span has just been created.

```rb
# Indicate to reject the trace
span.context.sampling_priority = Datadog::Ext::Priority::USER_REJECT

# Indicate to keep the trace
span.context.sampling_priority = Datadog::Ext::Priority::USER_KEEP
```

### Distributed Tracing

To trace requests across hosts, the spans on the secondary hosts must be linked together by setting ``trace_id`` and ``parent_id``:

    def request_on_secondary_host(parent_trace_id, parent_span_id)
        tracer.trace('web.request') do |span|
           span.parent_id = parent_span_id
           span.trace_id = parent_trace_id

           # perform user code
        end
    end

Users can pass along the ``parent_trace_id`` and ``parent_span_id`` via whatever method best matches the RPC framework.

Below is an example using Net/HTTP and Sinatra, where we bypass the integrations to demo how distributed tracing works.

On the client:

    require 'net/http'
    require 'ddtrace'

    uri = URI('http://localhost:4567/')

    Datadog.tracer.trace('web.call') do |span|
      req = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
      req['x-datadog-trace-id'] = span.trace_id.to_s
      req['x-datadog-parent-id'] = span.span_id.to_s

      response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port) do |http|
        http.request(req)
      end

      puts response.body
    end

On the server:

    require 'sinatra'
    require 'ddtrace'

    get '/' do
      parent_trace_id = request.env['HTTP_X_DATADOG_TRACE_ID']
      parent_span_id = request.env['HTTP_X_DATADOG_PARENT_ID']

      Datadog.tracer.trace('web.work') do |span|
         if parent_trace_id && parent_span_id
           span.trace_id = parent_trace_id.to_i
           span.parent_id = parent_span_id.to_i
         end

        'Hello world!'
      end
    end

[Rack](#Rack) and [Net/HTTP](#Net_HTTP) have experimental support for this, they
can send and receive these headers automatically and tie spans together automatically,
provided you pass a ``:distributed_tracing`` option set to ``true``.

This is disabled by default.

### Processing Pipeline

Sometimes it might be interesting to intercept `Span` objects before they get
sent upstream.  To achieve that, you can hook custom *processors* into the
pipeline using the method `Datadog::Pipeline.before_flush`:

    Datadog::Pipeline.before_flush(
      # filter the Span if the given block evaluates true
      Datadog::Pipeline::SpanFilter.new { |span| span.resource =~ /PingController/ },
      Datadog::Pipeline::SpanFilter.new { |span| span.get_tag('host') == 'localhost' }

      # alter the Span updating fields or tags
      Datadog::Pipeline::SpanProcessor.new { |span| span.resource.gsub!(/password=.*/, '') }
    )

For more information, please refer to this [link](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-rb/pull/214).
