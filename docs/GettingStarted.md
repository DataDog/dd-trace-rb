## Installation

The following steps will help you quickly start tracing your Ruby application.

### Setup the Datadog Agent

The Ruby APM tracer sends trace data through the Datadog Agent.

[Install and configure the Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/setup), see additional documentation for [tracing Docker applications](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/setup/docker/).

### Quickstart for Rails applications

1. Add the `ddtrace` gem to your Gemfile:

    ```ruby
    source 'https://rubygems.org'
    gem 'ddtrace'
    ```

2. Install the gem with `bundle install`
3. Create a `config/initializers/datadog.rb` file containing:

    ```ruby
    Datadog.configure do |c|
      # This will activate auto-instrumentation for Rails
      c.use :rails
    end
    ```

    You can also activate additional integrations here (see [Integration instrumentation](#integration-instrumentation))

### Quickstart for Ruby applications

1. Install the gem with `gem install ddtrace`
2. Add a configuration block to your Ruby application:

    ```ruby
    require 'ddtrace'
    Datadog.configure do |c|
      # Configure the tracer here.
      # Activate integrations, change tracer settings, etc...
      # By default without additional configuration, nothing will be traced.
    end
    ```

3. Add or activate instrumentation by doing either of the following:
    1. Activate integration instrumentation (see [Integration instrumentation](#integration-instrumentation))
    2. Add manual instrumentation around your code (see [Manual instrumentation](#manual-instrumentation))

### Quickstart for OpenTracing

1. Install the gem with `gem install ddtrace`
2. To your OpenTracing configuration file, add the following:

    ```ruby
    require 'opentracing'
    require 'ddtrace'
    require 'ddtrace/opentracer'

    # Activate the Datadog tracer for OpenTracing
    OpenTracing.global_tracer = Datadog::OpenTracer::Tracer.new
    ```

3. (Optional) Add a configuration block to your Ruby application to configure Datadog with:

    ```ruby
    Datadog.configure do |c|
      # Configure the Datadog tracer here.
      # Activate integrations, change tracer settings, etc...
      # By default without additional configuration,
      # no additional integrations will be traced, only
      # what you have instrumented with OpenTracing.
    end
    ```

4. (Optional) Add or activate additional instrumentation by doing either of the following:
    1. Activate Datadog integration instrumentation (see [Integration instrumentation](#integration-instrumentation))
    2. Add Datadog manual instrumentation around your code (see [Manual instrumentation](#manual-instrumentation))

### Final steps for installation

After setting up, your services will appear on the [APM services page](https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/services) within a few minutes. Learn more about [using the APM UI][visualization docs].

## Manual Instrumentation

If you aren't using a supported framework instrumentation, you may want to to manually instrument your code.

To trace any Ruby code, you can use the `Datadog.tracer.trace` method:

```ruby
Datadog.tracer.trace(name, options) do |span|
  # Wrap this block around the code you want to instrument
  # Additionally, you can modify the span here.
  # e.g. Change the resource name, set tags, etc...
end
```

Where `name` should be a `String` that describes the generic kind of operation being done (e.g. `'web.request'`, or `'request.parse'`)

And `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `service`     | `String` | The service name which this span belongs (e.g. `'my-web-service'`) | Tracer `default-service`, `$PROGRAM_NAME` or `'ruby'` |
| `resource`    | `String` | Name of the resource or action being operated on. Traces with the same resource value will be grouped together for the purpose of metrics (but still independently viewable.) Usually domain specific, such as a URL, query, request, etc. (e.g. `'Article#submit'`, `http://example.com/articles/list`.) | `name` of Span. |
| `span_type`   | `String` | The type of the span (such as `'http'`, `'db'`, etc.) | `nil` |
| `child_of`    | `Datadog::Span` / `Datadog::Context` | Parent for this span. If not provided, will automatically become current active span. | `nil` |
| `start_time`  | `Integer` | When the span actually starts. Useful when tracing events that have already happened. | `Time.now.utc` |
| `tags`        | `Hash` | Extra tags which should be added to the span. | `{}` |
| `on_error`    | `Proc` | Handler invoked when a block is provided to trace, and it raises an error. Provided `span` and `error` as arguments. Sets error on the span by default. | `proc { |span, error| span.set_error(error) unless span.nil? }` |

It's highly recommended you set both `service` and `resource` at a minimum. Spans without a `service` or `resource` as `nil` will be discarded by the Datadog agent.

Example of manual instrumentation in action:

```ruby
get '/posts' do
  Datadog.tracer.trace('web.request', service: 'my-blog', resource: 'GET /posts') do |span|
    # Trace the activerecord call
    Datadog.tracer.trace('posts.fetch') do
      @posts = Posts.order(created_at: :desc).limit(10)
    end

    # Add some APM tags
    span.set_tag('http.method', request.request_method)
    span.set_tag('posts.count', @posts.length)

    # Trace the template rendering
    Datadog.tracer.trace('template.render') do
      erb :index
    end
  end
end
```

**Asynchronous tracing**

It might not always be possible to wrap `Datadog.tracer.trace` around a block of code. Some event or notification based instrumentation might only notify you when an event begins or ends.

To trace these operations, you can trace code asynchronously by calling `Datadog.tracer.trace` without a block:

```ruby
# Some instrumentation framework calls this after an event began and finished...
def db_query(start, finish, query)
  span = Datadog.tracer.trace('database.query')
  span.resource = query
  span.start_time = start
  span.finish(finish)
end
```

Calling `Datadog.tracer.trace` without a block will cause the function to return a `Datadog::Span` that is started, but not finished. You can then modify this span however you wish, then close it `finish`.

*You must not leave any unfinished spans.* If any spans are left open when the trace completes, the trace will be discarded. You can [activate debug mode](#tracer-settings) to check for warnings if you suspect this might be happening.

To avoid this scenario when handling start/finish events, you can use `Datadog.tracer.active_span` to get the current active span.

```ruby
# e.g. ActiveSupport::Notifications calls this when an event starts
def start(name, id, payload)
  # Start a span
  Datadog.tracer.trace(name)
end

# e.g. ActiveSupport::Notifications calls this when an event finishes
def finish(name, id, payload)
  # Retrieve current active span (thread-safe)
  current_span = Datadog.tracer.active_span
  unless current_span.nil?
    current_span.resource = payload[:query]
    current_span.finish
  end
end
```
##### Enriching traces from nested methods

You can tag additional information to current active span from any method. Note however that if the method is called and there is no span currently active `active_span` will be nil.

```ruby
# e.g. adding tag to active span

current_span = Datadog.tracer.active_span
current_span.set_tag('my_tag', 'my_value') unless current_span.nil?
```

You can also get the root span of the current active trace using the `active_root_span` method. This method will return `nil` if there is no active trace.

```ruby
# e.g. adding tag to active root span

current_root_span = Datadog.tracer.active_root_span
current_root_span.set_tag('my_tag', 'my_value') unless current_root_span.nil?
```

## Integration instrumentation

Many popular libraries and frameworks are supported out-of-the-box, which can be auto-instrumented. Although they are not activated automatically, they can be easily activated and configured by using the `Datadog.configure` API:

```ruby
Datadog.configure do |c|
  # Activates and configures an integration
  c.use :integration_name, options
end
```

`options` is a `Hash` of integration-specific configuration settings.

For a list of available integrations, and their configuration options, please refer to the following:

### Active Model Serializers

The Active Model Serializers integration traces the `serialize` event for version 0.9+ and the `render` event for version 0.10+.

```ruby
require 'active_model_serializers'
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :active_model_serializers, options
end

my_object = MyModel.new(name: 'my object')
ActiveModelSerializers::SerializableResource.new(test_obj).serializable_hash
```

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `service_name` | Service name used for `active_model_serializers` instrumentation. | `'active_model_serializers'` |
| `tracer` | `Datadog::Tracer` used to perform instrumentation. Usually you don't need to set this. | `Datadog.tracer` |

### Active Record

Most of the time, Active Record is set up as part of a web framework (Rails, Sinatra...) however it can be set up alone:

```ruby
require 'tmpdir'
require 'sqlite3'
require 'active_record'
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :active_record, options
end

Dir::Tmpname.create(['test', '.sqlite']) do |db|
  conn = ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: 'sqlite3',
                                                 database: db)
  conn.connection.execute('SELECT 42') # traced!
end
```

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| ---| --- | --- |
| `orm_service_name` | Service name used for the Ruby ORM portion of `active_record` instrumentation. Overrides service name for ORM spans if explicitly set, which otherwise inherit their service from their parent. | `'active_record'` |
| `service_name` | Service name used for database portion of `active_record` instrumentation. | Name of database adapter (e.g. `'mysql2'`) |
| `tracer` | `Datadog::Tracer` used to perform instrumentation. Usually you don't need to set this. | `Datadog.tracer` |

**Configuring trace settings per database**

You can configure trace settings per database connection by using the `describes` option:

```ruby
# Provide a `:describes` option with a connection key.
# Any of the following keys are acceptable, and equivalent to one another.
# If a block is provided, it yields a Settings object that
# accepts any of the configuration options listed above.

Datadog.configure do |c|
  # Symbol matching your database connection in config/database.yml
  # Only available if you are using Rails with ActiveRecord.
  c.use :active_record, describes: :secondary_database, service_name: 'secondary-db'

  c.use :active_record, describes: :secondary_database do |second_db|
    second_db.service_name = 'secondary-db'
  end

  # Connection string with the following connection settings:
  # Adapter, user, host, port, database
  c.use :active_record, describes: 'mysql2://root@127.0.0.1:3306/mysql', service_name: 'secondary-db'

  # Hash with following connection settings
  # Adapter, user, host, port, database
  c.use :active_record, describes: {
      adapter:  'mysql2',
      host:     '127.0.0.1',
      port:     '3306',
      database: 'mysql',
      username: 'root'
    },
    service_name: 'secondary-db'
end
```

If ActiveRecord traces an event that uses a connection that matches a key defined by `describes`, it will use the trace settings assigned to that connection. If the connection does not match any of the described connections, it will use default settings defined by `c.use :active_record` instead.

### AWS

The AWS integration will trace every interaction (e.g. API calls) with AWS services (S3, ElastiCache etc.).

```ruby
require 'aws-sdk'
require 'ddtrace'

connection.get
```

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `distributed_tracing` | Enables [distributed tracing](#distributed-tracing) | `false` |
| `error_handler` | A `Proc` that accepts a `response` parameter. If it evaluates to a *truthy* value, the trace span is marked as an error. By default only sets 5XX responses as errors. | `nil` |

    Datadog::Contrib::Excon::Middleware.with(options),
    Excon::Middleware::Idempotent
  ]
)
```

Where `options` is a Hash that contains any of the parameters listed in the table above.

### Faraday

The `faraday` integration is available through the `ddtrace` middleware:

```ruby
require 'faraday'
require 'ddtrace'

  builder.use(:ddtrace, options)
  builder.adapter Faraday.default_adapter
end

connection.get('/foo')
```

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `distributed_tracing` | Enables [distributed tracing](#distributed-tracing) | `false` |
| `error_handler` | A `Proc` that accepts a `response` parameter. If it evaluates to a *truthy* value, the trace span is marked as an error. By default only sets 5XX responses as errors. | `nil` |

### Grape

The Grape integration adds the instrumentation to Grape endpoints and filters. This integration can work side by side with other integrations like Rack and Rails.

To activate your integration, use the `Datadog.configure` method before defining your Grape application:

```ruby
# api.rb
require 'grape'
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :grape, options
end

# Then define your application
class RackTestingAPI < Grape::API
  desc 'main endpoint'
  get :success do
    'Hello world!'
  end
end
```

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `service_name` | Service name used for `grape` instrumentation | `'grape'` |
| `tracer` | `Datadog::Tracer` used to perform instrumentation. Usually you don't need to set this. | `Datadog.tracer` |

### GraphQL

The GraphQL integration activates instrumentation for GraphQL queries.

To activate your integration, use the `Datadog.configure` method:

```ruby
# Inside Rails initializer or equivalent
Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :graphql, schemas: [YourSchema], options
end

# Then run a GraphQL query
YourSchema.execute(query, variables: {}, context: {}, operation_name: nil)
```

The `use :graphql` method accepts the following parameters. Additional options can be substituted in for `options`:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `service_name` | Service name used for `graphql` instrumentation | `'ruby-graphql'` |
| `schemas` | Required. Array of `GraphQL::Schema` objects which to trace. Tracing will be added to all the schemas listed, using the options provided to this configuration. If you do not provide any, then tracing will not be activated. | `[]` |
| `tracer` | `Datadog::Tracer` used to perform instrumentation. Usually you don't need to set this. | `Datadog.tracer` |

**Manually configuring GraphQL schemas**

If you prefer to individually configure the tracer settings for a schema (e.g. you have multiple schemas with different service names), in the schema definition, you can add the following [using the GraphQL API](http://graphql-ruby.org/queries/tracing.html):

```ruby
YourSchema = GraphQL::Schema.define do
  use(
    GraphQL::Tracing::DataDogTracing,
    service: 'graphql'
  )
end
```

Or you can modify an already defined schema:

```ruby
YourSchema.define do
  use(
    GraphQL::Tracing::DataDogTracing,
    service: 'graphql'
  )
end
```

Do *NOT* `use :graphql` in `Datadog.configure` if you choose to configure manually, as to avoid double tracing. These two means of configuring GraphQL tracing are considered mutually exclusive.

### gRPC

The `grpc` integration adds both client and server interceptors, which run as middleware prior to executing the service's remote procedure call. As gRPC applications are often distributed, the integration shares trace information between client and server.

To setup your integration, use the `Datadog.configure` method like so:

```ruby
require 'grpc'
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :grpc, options
end

# Server side
server = GRPC::RpcServer.new
server.add_http2_port('localhost:50051', :this_port_is_insecure)
server.handle(Demo)
server.run_till_terminated

# Client side
client = Demo.rpc_stub_class.new('localhost:50051', :this_channel_is_insecure)
client.my_endpoint(DemoMessage.new(contents: 'hello!'))
```

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `service_name` | Service name used for `grpc` instrumentation | `'grpc'` |
| `tracer` | `Datadog::Tracer` used to perform instrumentation. Usually you don't need to set this. | `Datadog.tracer` |

**Configuring clients to use different settings**

In situations where you have multiple clients calling multiple distinct services, you may pass the Datadog interceptor directly, like so

```ruby
configured_interceptor = Datadog::Contrib::GRPC::DatadogInterceptor::Client.new do |c|
  c.service_name = "Alternate"
end

alternate_client = Demo::Echo::Service.rpc_stub_class.new(
  'localhost:50052',
  :this_channel_is_insecure,
  :interceptors => [configured_interceptor]
)
```

The integration will ensure that the `configured_interceptor` establishes a unique tracing setup for that client instance.

### MongoDB

The integration traces any `Command` that is sent from the [MongoDB Ruby Driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver) to a MongoDB cluster. By extension, Object Document Mappers (ODM) such as Mongoid are automatically instrumented if they use the official Ruby driver. To activate the integration, simply:

```ruby
require 'mongo'
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :mongo, options
end

# Create a MongoDB client and use it as usual
client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'artists')
collection = client[:people]
collection.insert_one({ name: 'Steve' })

# In case you want to override the global configuration for a certain client instance
Datadog.configure(client, options)
```

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |

client.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE group='x'")
```

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |

require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :http, options
end

Net::HTTP.start('127.0.0.1', 8080) do |http|
  request = Net::HTTP::Get.new '/index'
  response = http.request(request)
end

content = Net::HTTP.get(URI('http://127.0.0.1/index.html'))
```

```ruby
client = Net::HTTP.new(host, port)
Datadog.configure(client, options)
```

### Racecar

The Racecar integration provides tracing for Racecar jobs.

You can enable it through `Datadog.configure`:

```ruby
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :racecar, options
end
```

| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `service_name` | Service name used for `racecar` instrumentation | `'racecar'` |
| `tracer` | `Datadog::Tracer` used to perform instrumentation. Usually you don't need to set this. | `Datadog.tracer` |

### Rack

The Rack integration provides a middleware that traces all requests before they reach the underlying framework or application. It responds to the Rack minimal interface, providing reasonable values that can be retrieved at the Rack level.

This integration is automatically activated with web frameworks like Rails. If you're using a plain Rack application, just enable the integration it to your `config.ru`:

```ruby
# config.ru example
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :rack, options
end

use Datadog::Contrib::Rack::TraceMiddleware

app = proc do |env|

  # http://example.com/path?category_id=1&sort_by=asc#featured --> http://example.com/path?category_id&sort_by
  # http://example.com/path?categories[]=1&categories[]=2 --> http://example.com/path?categories[]

  # Show values for any query string parameter matching 'category_id' exactly
  # http://example.com/path?category_id=1&sort_by=asc#featured --> http://example.com/path?category_id=1&sort_by
  c.use :rack, quantize: { query: { show: ['category_id'] } }

  c.use :rack, quantize: { fragment: :show }
end
```

### Rails

The Rails integration will trace requests, database calls, templates rendering and cache read/write/delete operations. The integration makes use of the Active Support Instrumentation, listening to the Notification API so that any operation instrumented by the API is traced.

To enable the Rails instrumentation, create an initializer file in your `config/initializers` folder:

```ruby
# config/initializers/datadog.rb
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :rails, options
end
```

By default, without this option, it 'guesses' what a custom exception controller looks like. Providing this option aids this identification. | `nil` |
| `middleware` | Add the trace middleware to the Rails application. Set to `false` if you don't want the middleware to load. | `true` |
| `middleware_names` | Enables any short-circuited middleware requests to display the middleware name as resource for the trace. | `false` |
| `service_name` | Service name used when tracing application requests (on the `rack` level) | `'<app_name>'` (inferred from your Rails application namespace) |

### Rake

You can add instrumentation around your Rake tasks by activating the `rake` integration. Each task and its subsequent subtasks will be traced.

To activate Rake task tracing, add the following to your `Rakefile`:

```ruby
# At the top of your Rakefile:
require 'rake'
require 'ddtrace'

  c.use :rake, quantize: { args: { show: [:two] } }

  # Show all values for all arguments.
  # `rake.invoke.args` tag  --> ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
  # `rake.execute.args` tag --> { one: 'foo', two: 'bar', three: 'baz' }
  c.use :rake, quantize: { args: { show: :all } }

  # Totally exclude any argument matching :three exactly

| `tracer` | `Datadog::Tracer` used to perform instrumentation. Usually you don't need to set this. | `Datadog.tracer` |

You can also set *per-instance* configuration as it follows:

```ruby
customer_cache = Redis.new
invoice_cache = Redis.new

Datadog.configure(customer_cache, service_name: 'customer-cache')
Datadog.configure(invoice_cache, service_name: 'invoice-cache')

# Traced call will belong to `customer-cache` service
customer_cache.get(...)
# Traced call will belong to `invoice-cache` service
invoice_cache.get(...)
```

### Resque

The Resque integration uses Resque hooks that wraps the `perform` method.

To add tracing to a Resque job, simply do as follows:

```ruby
require 'ddtrace'

class MyJob
  def self.perform(*args)
    # do_something
  end
end

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :resque, options
end
```

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `service_name` | Service name used for `resque` instrumentation | `'resque'` |
| `tracer` | `Datadog::Tracer` used to perform instrumentation. Usually you don't need to set this. | `Datadog.tracer` |
| `workers` | An array including all worker classes you want to trace (eg `[MyJob]`) | `[]` |

### Rest Client

The `rest-client` integration is available through the `ddtrace` middleware:

```ruby
require 'rest_client'
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :rest_client, options
end
```

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `distributed_tracing` | Enables [distributed tracing](#distributed-tracing) | `false` |
| `service_name` | Service name for `rest_client` instrumentation. | `'rest_client'` |
| `tracer` | `Datadog::Tracer` used to perform instrumentation. Usually you don't need to set this. | `Datadog.tracer` |

### Sequel

The Sequel integration traces queries made to your database.

```ruby
require 'sequel'
require 'ddtrace'

# Connect to database
database = Sequel.sqlite

# Create a table
database.create_table :articles do
  primary_key :id
  String :name
end

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :sequel, options
end

# Perform a query
articles = database[:articles]
articles.all
```

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `service_name` | Service name for `sequel` instrumentation | Name of database adapter (e.g. `'mysql2'`) |
| `tracer` | `Datadog::Tracer` used to perform instrumentation. Usually you don't need to set this. | `Datadog.tracer` |

Only Ruby 2.0+ is supported.

**Configuring databases to use different settings**

If you use multiple databases with Sequel, you can give each of them different settings by configuring their respective `Sequel::Database` objects:

```ruby
sqlite_database = Sequel.sqlite
postgres_database = Sequel.connect('postgres://user:password@host:port/database_name')

# Configure each database with different service names
Datadog.configure(sqlite_database, service_name: 'my-sqlite-db')
Datadog.configure(postgres_database, service_name: 'my-postgres-db')
```

### Sidekiq

The Sidekiq integration is a server-side middleware which will trace job executions.

You can enable it through `Datadog.configure`:

```ruby
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :sidekiq, options
end
```

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `service_name` | Service name used for `sidekiq` instrumentation | `'sidekiq'` |
| `tracer` | `Datadog::Tracer` used to perform instrumentation. Usually you don't need to set this. | `Datadog.tracer` |

### Sinatra

The Sinatra integration traces requests and template rendering.

To start using the tracing client, make sure you import `ddtrace` and `use :sinatra` after either `sinatra` or `sinatra/base`, and before you define your application/routes:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :sinatra, options
end

get '/' do
  'Hello world!'
end
```

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `distributed_tracing` | Enables [distributed tracing](#distributed-tracing) so that this service trace is connected with a trace of another service if tracing headers are received | `false` |
| `headers` | Hash of HTTP request or response headers to add as tags to the `sinatra.request`. Accepts `request` and `response` keys with Array values e.g. `['Last-Modified']`. Adds `http.request.headers.*` and `http.response.headers.*` tags respectively. | `{ response: ['Content-Type', 'X-Request-ID'] }` |
| `resource_script_names` | Prepend resource names with script name | `false` |
| `service_name` | Service name used for `sinatra` instrumentation | `'sinatra'` |
| `tracer` | `Datadog::Tracer` used to perform instrumentation. Usually you don't need to set this. | `Datadog.tracer` |

### Sucker Punch

The `sucker_punch` integration traces all scheduled jobs:

```ruby
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.use :sucker_punch, options
end

# Execution of this job is traced
LogJob.perform_async('login')
```

Where `options` is an optional `Hash` that accepts the following parameters:

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `service_name` | Service name used for `sucker_punch` instrumentation | `'sucker_punch'` |
| `tracer` | `Datadog::Tracer` used to perform instrumentation. Usually you don't need to set this. | `Datadog.tracer` |

## Advanced configuration

### Tracer settings

To change the default behavior of the Datadog tracer, you can provide custom options inside the `Datadog.configure` block as in:

```ruby
# config/initializers/datadog.rb

Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.tracer option_name: option_value, ...
end
```

Available options are:

 - `debug`: set to true to enable debug mode. See [Using debug logging](#using-debug-logging) for more details.
 - `enabled`: defines if the `tracer` is enabled or not. If set to `false` the code could be still instrumented because of other settings, but no spans are sent to the local trace agent.
 - `env`: set the environment. Rails users may set it to `Rails.env` to use their application settings.
 - `hostname`: set the hostname of the trace agent.
 - `log`: defines a custom logger.
 - `partial_flush`: set to `true` to enable partial trace flushing (for long running traces.) Disabled by default. *Experimental.*
 - `port`: set the port the trace agent is listening on.
 - `statsd` set and activate Statsd for the tracer. See [Using debug stats](#using-debug-stats) for more details.
 - `tags`: set global tags that should be applied to all spans. Defaults to an empty hash

### Custom logging

By default, all logs are processed by the default Ruby logger. When using Rails, you should see the messages in your application log file.

Datadog client log messages are marked with `[ddtrace]` so you should be able to isolate them from other messages.

Additionally, it is possible to override the default logger and replace it by a custom one. This is done using the `log` attribute of the tracer.

```ruby
f = File.new("my-custom.log", "w+")           # Log messages should go there
Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.tracer log: Logger.new(f)                 # Overriding the default tracer
end

Datadog::Tracer.log.info { "this is typically called by tracing code" }
```

### Environment and tags

By default, the trace agent (not this library, but the program running in the background collecting data from various clients) uses the tags set in the agent config file, see our [environments tutorial](https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/docs/tutorials/environments) for details.

These values can be overridden at the tracer level:

```ruby
Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.tracer tags: { 'env' => 'prod' }
end
```

This enables you to set this value on a per tracer basis, so you can have for example several applications reporting for different environments on the same host.

Ultimately, tags can be set per span, but `env` should typically be the same for all spans belonging to a given trace.

### Sampling

`ddtrace` can perform trace sampling. While the trace agent already samples traces to reduce bandwidth usage, client sampling reduces performance overhead.

`Datadog::RateSampler` samples a ratio of the traces. For example:

```ruby
# Sample rate is between 0 (nothing sampled) to 1 (everything sampled).
sampler = Datadog::RateSampler.new(0.5) # sample 50% of the traces
Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.tracer sampler: sampler
end
```

#### Priority sampling

Priority sampling consists in deciding if a trace will be kept by using a priority attribute that will be propagated for distributed traces. Its value gives indication to the Agent and to the backend on how important the trace is.

The sampler can set the priority to the following values:

 - `Datadog::Ext::Priority::AUTO_REJECT`: the sampler automatically decided to reject the trace.
 - `Datadog::Ext::Priority::AUTO_KEEP`: the sampler automatically decided to keep the trace.

For now, priority sampling is disabled by default. Enabling it ensures that your sampled distributed traces will be complete. To enable the priority sampling:

```ruby
Datadog.configure do |c|
  c.tracer priority_sampling: true
end
```

Once enabled, the sampler will automatically assign a priority of 0 or 1 to traces, depending on their service and volume.

You can also set this priority manually to either drop a non-interesting trace or to keep an important one. For that, set the `context#sampling_priority` to:

 - `Datadog::Ext::Priority::USER_REJECT`: the user asked to reject the trace.
 - `Datadog::Ext::Priority::USER_KEEP`: the user asked to keep the trace.

When not using [distributed tracing](#distributed-tracing), you may change the priority at any time, as long as the trace is not finished yet. But it has to be done before any context propagation (fork, RPC calls) to be effective in a distributed context. Changing the priority after context has been propagated causes different parts of a distributed trace to use different priorities. Some parts might be kept, some parts might be rejected, and this can cause the trace to be partially stored and remain incomplete.

If you change the priority, we recommend you do it as soon as possible, when the root span has just been created.

```ruby
# Indicate to reject the trace
span.context.sampling_priority = Datadog::Ext::Priority::USER_REJECT

# Indicate to keep the trace
span.context.sampling_priority = Datadog::Ext::Priority::USER_KEEP
```

### Distributed Tracing

Distributed tracing allows traces to be propagated across multiple instrumented applications, so that a request can be presented as a single trace, rather than a separate trace per service.

To trace requests across application boundaries, the following must be propagated between each application:

| Property              | Type    | Description                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trace ID**          | Integer | ID of the trace. This value should be the same across all requests that belong to the same trace.                           |
| **Parent Span ID**    | Integer | ID of the span in the service originating the request. This value will always be different for each request within a trace. |
| **Sampling Priority** | Integer | Sampling priority level for the trace. This value should be the same across all requests that belong to the same trace.     |

Such propagation can be visualized as:

```
Service A:
  Trace ID:  100000000000000001
  Parent ID: 0
  Span ID:   100000000000000123
  Priority:  1

  |
  | Service B Request:
  |   Metadata:
  |     Trace ID:  100000000000000001
  |     Parent ID: 100000000000000123
  |     Priority:  1
  |
  V

Service B:
  Trace ID:  100000000000000001
  Parent ID: 100000000000000123
  Span ID:   100000000000000456
  Priority:  1

  |
  | Service C Request:
  |   Metadata:
  |     Trace ID:  100000000000000001
  |     Parent ID: 100000000000000456
  |     Priority:  1
  |
  V

Service C:
  Trace ID:  100000000000000001
  Parent ID: 100000000000000456
  Span ID:   100000000000000789
  Priority:  1
```

**Via HTTP**

For HTTP requests between instrumented applications, this trace metadata is propagated by use of HTTP Request headers:

| Property              | Type    | HTTP Header name              |
| --------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Trace ID**          | Integer | `x-datadog-trace-id`          |
| **Parent Span ID**    | Integer | `x-datadog-parent-id`         |
| **Sampling Priority** | Integer | `x-datadog-sampling-priority` |

Such that:

```
Service A:
  Trace ID:  100000000000000001
  Parent ID: 0
  Span ID:   100000000000000123
  Priority:  1

  |
  | Service B HTTP Request:
  |   Headers:
  |     x-datadog-trace-id:          100000000000000001
  |     x-datadog-parent-id:         100000000000000123
  |     x-datadog-sampling-priority: 1
  |
  V

Service B:
  Trace ID:  100000000000000001
  Parent ID: 100000000000000123
  Span ID:   100000000000000456
  Priority:  1

  |
  | Service B HTTP Request:
  |   Headers:
  |     x-datadog-trace-id:          100000000000000001
  |     x-datadog-parent-id:         100000000000000456
  |     x-datadog-sampling-priority: 1
  |
  V

Service C:
  Trace ID:  100000000000000001
  Parent ID: 100000000000000456
  Span ID:   100000000000000789
  Priority:  1
```

**Activating distributed tracing for integrations**

Many integrations included in `ddtrace` support distributed tracing. Distributed tracing is disabled by default, but can be activated via configuration settings.

- If your application receives requests from services with distributed tracing activated, you must activate distributed tracing on the integrations that handle these requests (e.g. Rails)
- If your application send requests to services with distributed tracing activated, you must activate distributed tracing on the integrations that send these requests (e.g. Faraday)
- If your application both sends and receives requests implementing distributed tracing, it must activate all integrations which handle these requests.

For more details on how to activate distributed tracing for integrations, see their documentation:

- [Excon](#excon)
- [Faraday](#faraday)
- [Rest Client](#restclient)
- [Net/HTTP](#nethttp)
- [Rack](#rack)
- [Rails](#rails)
- [Sinatra](#sinatra)

**Using the HTTP propagator**

To make the process of propagating this metadata easier, you can use the `Datadog::HTTPPropagator` module.

On the client:

```ruby
Datadog.tracer.trace('web.call') do |span|
  # Inject span context into headers (`env` must be a Hash)
  Datadog::HTTPPropagator.inject!(span.context, env)
end
```

On the server:

```ruby
Datadog.tracer.trace('web.work') do |span|
  # Build a context from headers (`env` must be a Hash)
  context = HTTPPropagator.extract(request.env)
  Datadog.tracer.provider.context = context if context.trace_id
end
```

### HTTP request queuing

Traces that originate from HTTP requests can be configured to include the time spent in a frontend web server or load balancer queue, before the request reaches the Ruby application.

This functionality is **experimental** and deactivated by default.

To activate this feature, you must add a `X-Request-Start` or `X-Queue-Start` header from your web server (i.e. Nginx). The following is an Nginx configuration example:

```
# /etc/nginx/conf.d/ruby_service.conf
server {
    listen 8080;

    location / {
      proxy_set_header X-Request-Start "t=${msec}";
      proxy_pass http://web:3000;
    }
}
```

Then you must enable the request queuing feature in the integration handling the request.

For Rack based applications, see the [documentation](#rack) for details for enabling this feature.

### Processing Pipeline

Some applications might require that traces be altered or filtered out before they are sent upstream. The processing pipeline allows users to create *processors* to define such behavior.

Processors can be any object that responds to `#call` accepting `trace` as an argument (which is an `Array` of `Datadog::Span`s.)

For example:

```ruby
lambda_processor = ->(trace) do
  # Processing logic...
  trace
end

class MyCustomProcessor
  def call(trace)
    # Processing logic...
    trace
  end
end
custom_processor = MyFancyProcessor.new
```

`#call` blocks of processors *must* return the `trace` object; this return value will be passed to the next processor in the pipeline.

These processors must then be added to the pipeline via `Datadog::Pipeline.before_flush`:

```ruby
Datadog::Pipeline.before_flush(lambda_processor, custom_processor)
```

You can also define processors using the short-hand block syntax for `Datadog::Pipeline.before_flush`:

```ruby
Datadog::Pipeline.before_flush do |trace|
  trace.delete_if { |span| span.name =~ /forbidden/ }
end
```

#### Filtering

You can use the `Datadog::Pipeline::SpanFilter` processor to remove spans, when the block evaluates as truthy:

```ruby
Datadog::Pipeline.before_flush(
  # Remove spans that match a particular resource
  Datadog::Pipeline::SpanFilter.new { |span| span.resource =~ /PingController/ },
  # Remove spans that are trafficked to localhost
  Datadog::Pipeline::SpanFilter.new { |span| span.get_tag('host') == 'localhost' }
)
```

#### Processing

You can use the `Datadog::Pipeline::SpanProcessor` processor to modify spans:

```ruby
Datadog::Pipeline.before_flush(
  # Strip matching text from the resource field
  Datadog::Pipeline::SpanProcessor.new { |span| span.resource.gsub!(/password=.*/, '') }
)
```

### OpenTracing

For setting up Datadog with OpenTracing, see out [Quickstart for OpenTracing](#quickstart-for-opentracing) section for details.

**Configuring Datadog tracer settings**

The underlying Datadog tracer can be configured by passing options (which match `Datadog::Tracer`) when configuring the global tracer:

```ruby
# Where `options` is a Hash of options provided to Datadog::Tracer
OpenTracing.global_tracer = Datadog::OpenTracer::Tracer.new(options)
```

It can also be configured by using `Datadog.configure` described in the [Tracer settings](#tracer-settings) section.

**Activating and configuring integrations**

By default, configuring OpenTracing with Datadog will not automatically activate any additional instrumentation provided by Datadog. You will only receive spans and traces from OpenTracing instrumentation you have in your application.

However, additional instrumentation provided by Datadog can be activated alongside OpenTracing using `Datadog.configure`, which can be used to further enhance your tracing. To activate this, see [Integration instrumentation](#integration-instrumentation) for more details.

**Supported serialization formats**

| Type                           | Supported? | Additional information |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| `OpenTracing::FORMAT_TEXT_MAP` | Yes        |                        |
| `OpenTracing::FORMAT_RACK`     | Yes        | Because of the loss of resolution in the Rack format, please note that baggage items with names containing either upper case characters or `-` will be converted to lower case and `_` in a round-trip respectively. We recommend avoiding these characters, or accommodating accordingly on the receiving end. |
| `OpenTracing::FORMAT_BINARY`   | No         |                        |

### Debugging

If you are having difficulty using the tracer, the library offers a few debugging features to give you more insight into the internals of tracing.

#### Using debug logging

Debug logging can be activate to produce verbose logs that detail the operations of the tracer, by enabling it on the tracer settings:

```ruby
# config/initializers/datadog.rb
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  # Activates debug mode for the tracer
  c.tracer debug: true
end
```

Both the tracer and its integrations will produce detailed messages of operations to your configured log file.

Be aware that *debug logging can produce many messages*, especially in applications with higher throughput. We generally recommend that this flag only be used in controlled, fail-safe environments (e.g. staging)

#### Using debug stats

To gather metrics regarding the internals of the trace library (such as number of traces flushed, number of errors, etc), one can enable debug metrics, which are collected using the `dogstatsd-ruby` library.

To activate, first add `gem 'dogstatsd-ruby'` to your Gemfile, then add the following to your configuration file:

```ruby
# config/initializers/datadog.rb
require 'datadog/statsd'
require 'ddtrace'

Datadog.configure do |c|
  # Activates Statsd metric collection for debugging purposes.
  # Configure with host and port of Datadog agent; defaults to 'localhost:8125'.
  c.tracer statsd: Datadog::Statsd.new
end
```

See the [Dogstatsd documentation](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/DataDog/dogstatsd-ruby/master/frames) for more details about configuring `Datadog::Statsd`.

After activation, the tracer will send the following metrics:

| Name                                                     | Type           | Description                                                      |

| `datadog.tracer.transport.http.roundtrip_time`           | `distribution` | Time to POST payload to agent, including TCP connect time.       |
| `datadog.tracer.writer.flush_time`                       | `distribution` | Time to flush data including serialization, TCP, and callbacks.  |

In addition, all metrics will include the following tags:

| Name                              | Description                                                         |
