= \Datadog Trace Client

_ddtrace_ is Datadog’s tracing client for Ruby. It is used to trace requests as they flow across web servers,
databases and microservices so that developers have great visiblity into bottlenecks and troublesome requests.

== Installation

Install the tracer with the +gem+ command, but point to Datadog's gems repository:

    $ gem install ddtrace --source http://gems.datadoghq.com/trace/

On the other hand, if you're using +Bundler+, just update your +Gemfile+ as follows:

    source 'https://rubygems.org'

    # tracing gem
    gem 'ddtrace', :source => 'http://gems.datadoghq.com/trace/'

If you're using the Ruby on Rails framework, you need to configure the auto-instrumentation with an {extra step}[#label-Auto+Instrumentation].

== Quickstart (Auto Instrumentation)

If you are on a {supported integration}[#label-Integrations], you should be able to generate traffic and view
metrics in your {dashboard}[https://app.datadoghq.com/trace].

== Quickstart (Manual Instrumentation)

If you aren't using a supported framework instrumentation, you may want to to manually instrument your code.
Adding tracing to your code is very simple. As an example, let’s imagine we have a web server and we want
to trace requests to the home page:

    require 'ddtrace'
    require 'sinatra'
    require 'activerecord'

    # a generic tracer that you can use across your application
    tracer = Datadog.tracer

    get '/' do
      tracer.trace('web.request') do |span|
        # set some span metadata
        span.service = 'my-web-site'
        span.resource = '/'
        span.set_tag('http.method', request.request_method)

        # trace the activerecord call
        tracer.trace('posts.fetch') do
          @posts = Posts.order(created_at: :desc).limit(10)
        end

        # trace the template rendering
        tracer.trace('template.render') do
          erb :index
        end
      end
    end

== Glossary

[Service] The name of a set of processes that do the same job. Some examples are +datadog-web-app+ or +datadog-metrics-db+.

[Resource] A particular query to a service. For a web application, some examples might be a URL stem like +/user/home+ or a
           handler function like +web.user.home+. For a SQL database, a resource would be the SQL of the query itself like
           <tt>select * from users where id = ?</tt>.
           You can track thousands (not millions or billions) of unique resources per services, so prefer resources like
           +/user/home+ rather than <tt>/user/home?id=123456789</tt>.

[Span] A span tracks a unit of work in a service, like querying a database or rendering a template. Spans are associated
       with a service and optionally a resource. Spans have names, start times, durations and optional tags.

== Integrations

=== Ruby on \Rails

The \Rails integration will trace requests, database calls, templates rendering and cache read/write/delete
operations. The integration makes use of the Active Support Instrumentation, listening to the Notification API
so that any operation instrumented by the API is traced.

The supported versions are:

* \Rails 3.2 (MRI interpreter, JRuby is experimental)
* \Rails 4.2 (MRI interpreter, JRuby is experimental)
* \Rails 5.0 (MRI interpreter)

The currently supported web server are:
* Puma 2.16+ and 3.6+
* Unicorn 4.8+ and 5.1+
* Passenger 5.0 (experimental)

==== Auto Instrumentation

Add the tracer gem to your +Gemfile+:

    gem 'ddtrace', :source => 'http://gems.datadoghq.com/trace/'

To enable the Rails auto-instrumentation, you must create an initializer file in your +config/+ folder:

    # config/initializers/datadog-tracer.rb

    Rails.configuration.datadog_trace = {
      auto_instrument: true,
      auto_instrument_redis: true,
      default_service: 'my-rails-app'
    }

If you're using \Rails 3 or higher, your application will be listed as +my-rails-app+ in your {dashboard}[https://app.datadoghq.com/trace].

==== Custom Instrumentation

If you need to instrument custom code within your controllers, you can simply:

    class CustomController < ApplicationController
      def index
        # using auto instrumentation, these calls are already traced
        @values = SomeModel.all
        @counter = Rails.cache.fetch('custom_cache_key')

        # use the global tracer to instrument your code
        tracer = Datadog.tracer
        tracer.trace('custom.service') do
          data = Something::fetch_data()
          @objects = Something::parse_data(data)
        end
      end
    end

With the auto instrumentation turned on, the result trace will include your span correctly nested under the
+rails.request+ span.

==== Tracer Configuration

All tracing settings are namespaced under the +Rails.configuration.datadog_tracer+ hash. To change the default behavior
of the Datadog tracer, you can override the following defaults:

    # config/initializers/datadog-tracer.rb

    Rails.configuration.datadog_trace = {
      enabled: true,
      auto_instrument: false,
      auto_instrument_redis: false,
      default_service: 'rails-app',
      default_cache_service: 'rails-cache',
      template_base_path: 'views/',
      tracer: Datadog.tracer,
      debug: false,
      trace_agent_hostname: 'localhost',
      trace_agent_port: 7777
    }

The available settings are:

* +enabled+: defines if the +tracer+ is enabled or not. If set to +false+ the code could be still instrumented
  because of other settings, but no spans are sent to the local trace agent.
* +auto_instrument+: if set to +true+ the code will be automatically instrumented. You may change this value
  with a condition, to enable the auto-instrumentation only for particular environments (production, staging, etc...).
* +auto_instrument_redis+: if set to +true+ \Redis calls will be traced as such. Calls to Redis cache may be
  still instrumented but you will not have the detail of low-level \Redis calls.
* +default_service+: set the service name used when tracing application requests. Defaults to +rails-app+
* +default_database_service+: set the database service name used when tracing database activity. Defaults to the
  current adapter name, so if you're using PostgreSQL it will be +postgres+.
* +default_cache_service+: set the cache service name used when tracing cache activity. Defaults to +rails-cache+
* +template_base_path+: used when the template name is parsed in the auto instrumented code. If you don't store
  your templates in the +views/+ folder, you may need to change this value
* +tracer+: is the global tracer used by the tracing application. Usually you don't need to change that value
  unless you're already using a different initialized +tracer+ somewhere else
* +debug+: set to true to enable debug logging.
* +trace_agent_hostname+: set the hostname of the trace agent.
* +trace_agent_port+: set the port the trace agent is listening on.

=== Redis

The \Redis integration will trace simple calls as well as pipelines.

    require 'redis'
    require 'ddtrace'

    Datadog::Monkey.patch_module(:redis) # you need to explicitly patch it

    # now do your Redis stuff, eg:
    redis = Redis.new
    redis.set 'foo', 'bar' # traced!

The \patch_module allows you to enable tracing on a per-library basis.
If you want to enable tracing for all supported integrations, you can simply
use \patch_all eg:

    require 'redis'
    require 'ddtrace'

    Datadog::Monkey.patch_all # enables all available integrations

    # now do your Redis stuff, eg:
    redis = Redis.new
    redis.set 'foo', 'bar' # traced!

=== Elastic Search

The \Elasticsearch integration will trace any call to \perform_request
in the \Client object:

    require 'elasticsearch/transport'
    require 'ddtrace'

    Datadog::Monkey.patch_module(:elasticsearch) # you need to explicitly patch it

    # now do your Elastic Search stuff, eg:
    client = Elasticsearch::Client.new url: 'http://127.0.0.1:9200'
    response = client.perform_request 'GET', '_cluster/health'

The \patch_module allows you to enable tracing on a per-library basis.
If you want to enable tracing for all supported integrations, you can simply
use \patch_all eg:

    require 'elasticsearch/transport'
    require 'ddtrace'

    Datadog::Monkey.patch_all # enables all available integrations

    # now do your Elastic Search stuff, eg:
    client = Elasticsearch::Client.new url: 'http://127.0.0.1:9200'
    response = client.perform_request 'GET', '_cluster/health'

== Monkey Patching

=== Patching methods

Integrations such as \Redis or \Elasticsearch use monkey patching.

The available methods are:

* +autopatch_modules+: returns a \Hash of all modules available for monkey patching,
  the key is the name of the module and the value \true or \false. If it is \true,
  a call to \patch_all will enable the module, if it is \false, it will do nothing.
* +patch_all+: patches all modules which are supported. Make sure all the necessary
  calls to \require have been done before this is alled, else monkey patching will
  not work.
* +patch_module+: patches a single module, regardless of its settings in the
  \autopatch_modules list.
* +patch+: patches some modules, you should pass a hash like the one returned
  by \autopatch_modules
* +get_patched_modules+: returns the list of patched modules, a module has been
  correctly patched only if it is in this hash, with a value set to \true.

Example:

    require 'ddtrace'

    puts Datadog::Monkey.autopatch_modules                   # lists all modules available for monkey patching
    Datadog::Monkey.patch_module(:redis)                     # patch only one module
    Datadog::Monkey.patch(elasticsearch: false, redis: true) # patch redis, but not elasticsearch
    Datadog::Monkey.patch_all                                # patch all the available modules
    puts Datadog::Monkey.get_patched_modules                 # tells wether modules are patched or not

It is safe to call \patch_all, \patch_module or \patch several times.
Make sure the library you want to patch is imported before you call \patch_module.
In doubt, check with \get_patched_modules.
Once a module is patched, it is not possible to unpatch it.

=== Patch Info (PIN)

The Patch Info, AKA \Pin object, gives you control on the integration.

It has one class method:

* +get_from+: returns the Pin object which has been pinned onto some random
  object. It is safe to call \get_from on any object, but it might return \nil.

Some instance methods:

* +enabled?+: wether tracing is enabled for this object
* +onto+: applies the patch information to some random object. It is the companion
  function of \get_from.

Accessors:

* +service+: service, you should typically set some meaningful value for this.
* +app+: application name
* +tags+: optional tags
* +app_type+: application type
* +name+: span name
* +tracer+: the tracer object used for tracing

By default, a traced integration such as \Redis or \Elasticsearch carries a \Pin object. Eg:

    require 'redis'
    require 'ddtrace'

    Datadog::Monkey.patch_all

    redis = Redis.new
    pin = Datadog::Pin.get_from(redis)
    pin.service = 'my-redis-cache'
    puts redis.get 'my-key' # this will be traced as belonging to 'my-redis-cache' service
    pin.tracer = nil
    puts pin.enabled?       # false
    puts redis.get 'my-key' # this won't be traced, tracing has been disabled now

You can use this object to instrument your own code:

    require 'ddtrace'
    require 'ddtrace/ext/app_types'

    class MyWebSite
      def initialize
        pin = Datadog::Pin.new('my-web-site', app_type: Datadog::Ext::AppTypes::WEB)
        Datadog::Pin.onto(self)
      end

      def serve(something)
        pin = Datadog::Pin.get_from(self)
        pin.tracer.trace('serve') do |span|
          span.resource = something
          span.service = pin.service
          # serve something here
        end
      end
    end

== Debug Mode

If you need to check locally what traces and spans are sent after each traced block, you can enable
a global debug mode for all tracers so that every time a trace is ready to be sent, the content will be
printed in the +STDOUT+. To enable the debug logging, add this code anywhere before using the tracer
for the first time:

    require 'ddtrace'
    require 'sinatra'
    require 'activerecord'

    # enable debug mode
    Datadog::Tracer.debug_logging = true

    # use the tracer as usual
    tracer = Datadog.tracer

    get '/' do
      tracer.trace('web.request') do |span|
        # ...
      end
    end

Remember that the debug mode may affect your application performance and so it must not be used
in a production environment.

== Supported Versions

The \Datadog Trace Client has been tested with the following Ruby versions:

* Ruby MRI 2.1
* Ruby MRI 2.2
* Ruby MRI 2.3
* JRuby 9.1.5 (experimental)

Other versions aren't yet officially supported.
