# Deprecation

Deprecated API objects are scheduled to be **removed in the next major version release**.

Deprecated objects can still be safely used until the next major version.

Objects will receive the deprecation tag in a minor version release,
allowing for deprecation warnings to be surfaced to users before the next major release.
