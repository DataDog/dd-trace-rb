              # > The problem is that the code assumes that both checks 1) and 2) will always reach the same conclusion:
              # > either profiler is supported, or profiler is not supported.
              # > In the problematic case, it looks like in your case check 1 decides that profiler is not
              # > supported => doesn't load it, and then check 2 decides that it is => assumes it is loaded and tries to
              # > start it.
