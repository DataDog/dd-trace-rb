      # Buffer that stores objects, has a maximum size, and
      # can be safely used concurrently with CRuby.
      #
      # Because singular +Array+ operations are thread-safe in CRuby,
      # we can implement the buffer without an explicit lock,
      # while making the compromise of allowing the buffer to go
      # over its maximum limit under extreme circumstances.
      #
      # On the following scenario:
      # * 4.5 million spans/second.
      # * Pushed into a single CRubyTraceBuffer from 1000 threads.
      #
      # This implementation allocates less memory and is faster
      # than {Datadog::Core::Buffer::ThreadSafe}.
