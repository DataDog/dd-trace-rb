      # Used to ensure that @components initialization/reconfiguration is performed one-at-a-time, by a single thread.
      #
      # This is important because components can end up being accessed from multiple application threads (for instance on
      # a threaded webserver), and we don't want their initialization to clash (for instance, starting two profilers...).
      #
      # Note that a Mutex **IS NOT** reentrant: the same thread cannot grab the same Mutex more than once.
      # This means below we are careful not to nest calls to methods that would trigger initialization and grab the lock.
      #
      # Every method that directly or indirectly mutates @components should be holding the lock (through
      # #safely_synchronize) while doing so.

      # We use a separate lock when reading the @components, so that they continue to be accessible during reconfiguration.
      # This was needed because we ran into several issues where we still needed to read the old
      # components while the COMPONENTS_WRITE_LOCK was being held (see https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-rb/pull/1387
      # and https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-rb/pull/1373#issuecomment-799593022 ).
      #
      # Technically on MRI we could get away without this lock, but on non-MRI Rubies, we may run into issues because
      # we fall into the "UnsafeDCLFactory" case of https://shipilev.net/blog/2014/safe-public-construction/ .
      # Specifically, on JRuby reads from the @components do NOT have volatile semantics, and on TruffleRuby they do
      # BUT just as an implementation detail, see https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/Concurrency-in-jruby#volatility and
