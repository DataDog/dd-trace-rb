# OpenTelemetry does not wait until the "root" span is finished to flush:

# The "root" OpenTelemetry span might be a span that is never finished, but
# instead a placeholder for distributed tracing information, and ultimately gets discarded.
# Consumers of the OpenTelemetry SpanProcessor pipeline are free to flush spans whenever
# an individual span is finished.
# Currently, this closely translates to Datadog's partial flushing.
