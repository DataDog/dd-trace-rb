# This file is used to load the profiling native extension. It works in two steps:
#
# 1. Load the datadog_profiling_loader extension. This extension will be used to load the actual extension, but in
#    a special way that avoids exposing native-level code symbols. See `datadog_profiling_loader.c` for more details.
#
# 2. Use the Datadog::Profiling::Loader exposed by the datadog_profiling_loader extension to load the actual
#    profiling native extension.
#
# All code on this file is on-purpose at the top-level; this makes it so this file is executed only once,
# the first time it gets required, to avoid any issues with the native extension being initialized more than once.
