      # To add just a bit more complexity to our detection code, in https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-rb/issues/3334
      # a user reported that our code was incorrectly flagging the mariadb variant of libmysqlclient as being
      # incompatible. In fact we have no reports of the mariadb variant needing the "no signals" workaround,
      # so we flag it as compatible when it's in use.
      #
      # A problem is that there doesn't seem to be an obvious way to query the mysql2 gem on which kind of
      # libmysqlclient it's using, so we detect it by looking at the version.
      #
      # The info method for mysql2 with mariadb looks something like this:
      # `{:id=>30308, :version=>"3.3.8", :header_version=>"11.2.2"}`
      #
      # * The version seems to come from https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-connector-c and the latest
      # one is 3.x.
      # * The header_version is what people usually see as the "mariadb version"
      #
      # As a comparison, for libmysql the info looks like:
      # * `{:id=>80035, :version=>"8.0.35", :header_version=>"8.0.35"}`
      #
      # Thus our detection is version 4 or older, because libmysqlclient 4 is almost 20 years old so it's most probably
      # not that one + header_version being 10 or newer, since according to https://endoflife.date/mariadb that's a
      # sane range for modern mariadb releases.
