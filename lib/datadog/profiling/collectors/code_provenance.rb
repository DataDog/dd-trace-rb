        # Why we do this: We do this to make sure that if there are libraries with paths that are prefixes of other
        # libraries, e.g. '/home/foo' and '/home/foo/bar', we match to the longest path first.
        # When reverse sorting paths as strings, '/home/foo/bar' will come before '/home/foo'.
        #
        # This way, when we iterate the @libraries_by_path hash, we know the first hit will also be the longest.
        #
        # Alternatively/in the future we could instead use a trie to match paths, but I doubt for the data sizes we're
        # looking at that a trie is that much faster than using Ruby's built-in native collections.
