      # TODO: Why does the Recorder directly reference the `code_provenance_collector`?
      #
      # For starters, this is weird/a problem because the relationship is supposed to go in the other direction:
      # collectors are supposed to record their results in the `Recorder`, rather than the `Recorder` having to know
      # about individual collectors.
      #
      # But the `code_provenance_collector` is different from other existing and potential collectors because it is not
      # asynchronous. It does not gather data over time and record it as it goes. Instead, you call it once per profile,
      # synchronously, and just use what it spits out.
      #
      # The current design of the `Recorder` is quite tied to the asynchronous model. Modifying our current design
      # to support synchronous collectors is non-trivial, and I decided not to go through with it because we're
      # soon going to replace the `Recorder` and many other existing classes with a
      # [libddprof](https://github.com/datadog/libddprof)-based implementation, and thus I don't think massive refactors
      # are worth it before moving to libddprof.
