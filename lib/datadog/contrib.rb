    # Registry is a global, declarative repository of all available integrations.
    #
    # Integrations should register themselves with the registry as early as
    # possible as the initial tracer configuration can only activate integrations
    # if they have already been registered.
    #
    # Despite that, integrations *can* be appended to the registry at any point
    # of the program execution. Newly appended integrations can then be
    # activated during tracer reconfiguration.
    #
    # The registry does not depend on runtime configuration and registered integrations
    # must execute correctly after successive configuration changes.
    # The registered integrations themselves can depend on the stateful configuration
    # of the tracer.
    #
    # `Datadog.registry` is a helper accessor to this constant, but it's only available
    # after the tracer has complete initialization. Use `Datadog::Contrib::REGISTRY` instead
    # of `Datadog.registry` when you code might be called during tracer initialization.
    REGISTRY = Registry.new
