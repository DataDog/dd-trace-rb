          # DEV-3.0: Backwards compatibility code for the 2.x gem series.
          # DEV-3.0:
          # DEV-3.0: `ActiveSupport::Cache` is now instrumented by subscribing to ActiveSupport::Notifications events.
          # DEV-3.0: The implementation is located at {Datadog::Tracing::Contrib::ActiveSupport::Cache::Events::Cache}.
          # DEV-3.0: The events emitted provide richer introspection points (e.g. events for cache misses on `#fetch`) while
          # DEV-3.0: also ensuring we are using Rails' public API for improved compatibility.
          # DEV-3.0:
          # DEV-3.0: But a few operations holds us back:
          # DEV-3.0: 1. `ActiveSupport::Cache::Store#fetch`:
          # DEV-3.0:   This method does not have an event that can produce an equivalent span to today's 2.x implementation.
          # DEV-3.0:   In 2.x, `#fetch` produces two separate, *nested* spans: one for the `#read` operation and
          # DEV-3.0:   another for the `#write` operation that is called internally by `#fetch` when the cache key needs
          # DEV-3.0:   to be populated on a cache miss.
          # DEV-3.0:   But the ActiveSupport events emitted by `#fetch` provide two *sibling* events for the`#read` and
          # DEV-3.0:   `#write` operations.
          # DEV-3.0:   Moving from nested spans to sibling spans would be a breaking change. One notable difference is
          # DEV-3.0:   that if the nested `#write` operation fails 2.x, the `#read` span is marked as an error. This would
          # DEV-3.0:   not be the case with sibling spans, and would be a very visible change.
          # DEV-3.0: 2. `ActiveSupport::Cache::Store#read_multi` & `ActiveSupport::Cache::Store#fetch_multi`:
          # DEV-3.0:   ActiveSupport events were introduced in ActiveSupport 5.2.0 for these methods.
          # DEV-3.0:
          # DEV-3.0: At the end of the day, moving to ActiveSupport events is the better approach, but we have to retain
          # DEV-3.0: this last few monkey patches (and all the supporting code) to avoid a breaking change for now.
