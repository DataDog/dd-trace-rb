    # used to represent a single logical trace, even if the trace is built
    # asynchronously.
    #
    # A single code execution may use multiple {Datadog::Tracing::Context} if part of the execution
    # must not be related to the current tracing. As example, a delayed job may
    # compose a standalone trace instead of being related to the same trace that
    # generates the job itself. On the other hand, if it's part of the same
    # {Datadog::Tracing::Context}, it will be related to the original trace.
