          # 2. `*`: matches a substring of any size, including zero.
          # These patterns can occur any point of the string, any number of times.

          # Both {SpanOperation#name} and {SpanOperation#service} must match the provided patterns.
          #
          # The whole String has to match the provided patterns: providing a pattern that
          # matches a portion of the provided String is not considered a match.
          #
          # @example web-*
          #   `'web-*'` will match any string starting with `web-`.
          # @example cache-?
          #   `'cache-?'` will match any string starting with `database-` followed by exactly one character.
