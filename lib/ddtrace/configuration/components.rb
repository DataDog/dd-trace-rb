            # > after Datadog.configure gets run.
            # > The problem is that the code assumes that both checks 1) and 2) will always reach the same conclusion:
            # > either profiler is supported, or profiler is not supported.
            # > In the problematic case, it looks like in your case check 1 decides that profiler is not
            # > supported => doesn't load it, and then check 2 decides that it is => assumes it is loaded and tries to
            # > start it.

            # TODO: As of June 2021, most checks in .supported? are related to the google-protobuf gem; so it's
