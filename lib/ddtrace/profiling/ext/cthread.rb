        # See https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17807 and the regression tests added to this module's specs for details.
        #
        # In those Ruby versions, there's a very special subclass of `Thread` called `Process::Waiter` that causes VM
        # crashes whenever something tries to read its instance variables. This subclass of thread only shows up when
        # the `Process.detach` API gets used.
        # In this module's specs you can find crash regression tests that include a way of reproducing it.
        #
        # The workaround is to use `defined?` to check first if the instance variable exists. This seems to be fine
        # with Ruby.
        # Note that this crash doesn't affect `@foo ||=` nor instance variable writes (after the first write ever of any
        # instance variable on a `Process::Waiter`, then further reads and writes to that or any other instance are OK;
        # it looks like there's some lazily-created structure that is missing and did not get created).
