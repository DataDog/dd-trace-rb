  # execution flow. During each logical execution, the same \Context is
  # used to represent a single logical trace, even if the trace is built
  # asynchronously.
  #
  # A single code execution may use multiple \Context if part of the execution
  # must not be related to the current tracing. As example, a delayed job may
  # compose a standalone trace instead of being related to the same trace that
  # generates the job itself. On the other hand, if it's part of the same
