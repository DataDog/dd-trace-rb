// sampling.

//       sampling intervals/skips that are dynamically adjusted over time.
//       It will not perform truly random sampling by "throwing a coin" at
//       every event and is thus, in theory, susceptible to some pattern
//       biases. In practice, the dynamic readjustment of sampling interval
//       and randomized starting point should help with avoiding heavy biases.
