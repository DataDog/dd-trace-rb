# Libdatadog development

These instructions can quickly get outdated, so feel free to open an issue if they're not working (and/or ping @ivoanjo).

## Using libdatadog builds from CI or GitHub

If you're developing inside docker/natively on Linux, you can use libdatadog builds from CI and GitHub.

Here's what to do:

1. Create a folder for extracting libdatadog into based on your ruby platform (for instance inside the dd-trace-rb repo):

```bash
export DD_RUBY_PLATFORM=`ruby -e 'puts Gem::Platform.local.to_s'`
echo "Current ruby platform: $DD_RUBY_PLATFORM"
mkdir -p my-libdatadog-build/$DD_RUBY_PLATFORM
```

2. Find a libdatadog build from CI or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/DataDog/libdatadog/releases). This should match the Ruby platform seen above.
3. Extract the libdatadog build into the folder:

```bash
# In this example the build is in my downloads; notice the use of strip-components to get the correct folder structure
tar zxvf ~/Downloads/libdatadog-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz -C my-libdatadog-build/$DD_RUBY_PLATFORM/ --strip-components=1
# Here's how it should look after
ls my-libdatadog-build/$DD_RUBY_PLATFORM
bin  cmake  include  lib  LICENSE  LICENSE-3rdparty.yml  NOTICE
```

6. Tell Ruby where to find libdatadog: ```export LIBDATADOG_VENDOR_OVERRIDE=`pwd`/my-libdatadog-build/``` (Notice no platform + use of pwd for full path here)
7. From dd-trace-rb, run `bundle exec rake clean compile`
8. For incremental builds, usually `bundle exec rake compile` is faster and `clean` is not needed

If you additionally want to run the profiler test suite, also remember to `export DD_PROFILING_MACOS_TESTING=true` and re-run `rake clean compile`.

## Native development on macOS

As of this writing (August 2025), the libdatadog builds on rubygems.org only support Linux.

We don't officially support using libdatadog for Ruby on other platforms yet, but it is possible to use it for local development on macOS.
(**Note that you don't need these instructions if you develop inside docker.**)

Here's how you can do so:

1. [Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Install `cbindgen`: `cargo install cbindgen`
3. Clone [libdatadog](https://github.com/datadog/libdatadog)
4. Create a folder for building into based on your ruby platform:

```bash
export DD_RUBY_PLATFORM=`ruby -e 'puts Gem::Platform.local.to_s'`
mkdir -p my-libdatadog-build/$DD_RUBY_PLATFORM
```

5. From inside of the libdatadog repo, build libdatadog into this folder: `./build-profiling-ffi.sh my-libdatadog-build/$DD_RUBY_PLATFORM`
6. Tell Ruby where to find libdatadog: `export LIBDATADOG_VENDOR_OVERRIDE=/adjust/this/to/be/the/full/path/to/my-libdatadog-build/` (Notice no platform here)
7. From dd-trace-rb, run `bundle exec rake clean compile`
8. For incremental builds, usually `bundle exec rake compile` is faster and `clean` is not needed

If you additionally want to run the profiler test suite, also remember to `export DD_PROFILING_MACOS_TESTING=true` and re-run `rake clean compile`.
